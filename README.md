# Neovim Configuration

This is my personal Neovim configuration, created using [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) as a reference.  

Kickstart.nvim is a **minimal**, **single-file**, and **fully documented** starting point for setting up Neovim. It's not a full Neovim distribution, but rather a clean base for creating your own setup.

## Why Kickstart?

I chose Kickstart.nvim because it provides:

- A clean, documented starting configuration for someone who has only ever used VSCode.
- A small and modular plugin setup powered by [`lazy.nvim`](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)  
- Flexibility to evolve the setup over time as I explore more Neovim and Lua features

## Installation

Follow the instructions from the original [kickstart.nvim README](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) to set up Neovim and its dependencies for your platform.

## Customizations

I've made a few adjustments such as creating independent files for each plugins; making it more modular and easy to manage. I've also added a few more plugins that I use (or at least I think I will) and will continue to tweak and make changes as I see fit. Feel free to use this as a starting point for your own setup!  

## Todo

- [ ] Migrate to vim.pack for handling plugins, once 0.12 is stable
